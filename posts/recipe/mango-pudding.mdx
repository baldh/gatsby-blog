Though beloved literary icon, Booker Prize-winner, and electric scooter enthusiast Margaret Atwood’s 1985 feminist dystopian urtext The Handmaid’s Tale—a chilling speculative vision of a repressive theocratic America in which women’s rights have been completely abolished—is undoubtedly her most famous work, the Canadian author’s wider body of speculative fiction imagines more than just violent misogyny as governmental policy. Whether focused on patriarchal totalitarianism (Handmaid’s Tale), human-wrought environmental destruction (the MaddAddam trilogy), or the grotesqueries of finance capitalism (The Heart Goes Last), they speak to our recent political climate in myriad, and disquieting, ways.

Alongside these darkly prophetic novels, however, Atwood has also produced award-winning historical fiction, biting satires, reimaginings of The Tempest and The Odyssey, pastiches of Gothic romances and fairy tales, quiet interrogations of identity and memory, and more. Basically, she can do it all (and that’s without mentioning the poetry, short fiction, nonfiction, graphic novels, children’s books, and libretti).

Today, we look back on what the critics (as well as some recognizable peers) first wrote about every one of her seventeen novels, from 1969’s The Edible Woman to 2019’s The Testaments.
